QUE.1-What are the differences between var, let and const?
ANS:- VAR:- 1.The scope of a var variable is functional scope.
            2.It can be declared without initialization.
            3.It can be accessed without initialization as its default value is “undefined”.

      LET:-1.The scope of a let variable is block scope.
           2.It can be declared without initialization.
           3.It cannot be accessed without initialization otherwise it will give ‘referenceError’.

     CONST:-1.The scope of a const variable is block scope.
            2.It cannot be declared without initialization.
            3.It cannot be accessed without initialization, as it cannot be declared without initialization.


QUE.2-Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN?
ANS:-Undefined: It means that the object doesn't have any value, therefore undefined.
               This occurs when you create a variable and don't assign a value to it.
               Undefined → The variable is not even created

    Notdefined:It works like when we did not declare the variable and try to call that variable.
    Null → The value is nothing but the variable is created.
           Null represents an empty value and carry no meaningful information.

    NaN - NaN stands for Not a Number. You get this value when you try to do some operation that can't yield a meaningful result


QUE.3-What is difference between null and undefined and where to use what?
ANS:-Undefined: It means that the object doesn't have any value, therefore undefined.
             This occurs when you create a variable and don't assign a value to it.
             Undefined → The variable is not even created
  Null → The value is nothing but the variable is created.
         Null represents an empty value and carry no meaningful information.

         Undefined means a variable has been declared but has yet not been assigned a value.
          Null is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value.


QUE.4-What is execution context ?
ANS:-When the JavaScript engine scans a script file, it makes an environment called the Execution Context 
   that handles the entire transformation and execution of the code.

QUE.5-What is use of prompt in JavaScript? 
ANS:-Javascript Window prompt() Method. The Javascript Window prompt() method is used to 
  display a dialog box with an optional message prompting the user to input some text.

QUE.6-Why JavaScript is Dyanmic Language?
ANS:-Being able to change the underlying type of a variable while the program is
   running without causing an error is what makes JavaScript a dynamic language.
